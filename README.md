# mastodon-outbox-widget

Hi, I wanted a widget on my website to show the latest X posts or reboosts of my mastodon account.

This widget consists of a few pieces: 

1. A python script wich gets the latest articles from the mastodon outbox and writes them to an rss file

2. A html page which reads in this rss file and shows it on a website
